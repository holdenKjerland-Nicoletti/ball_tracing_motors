# ball_tracing_motors

For an engineering project I have created a robot that is able to follow a orange ball. There can be many uses for the robot, but the main idea is to carry objects for people that need help
Uses a robot chassis from spark fun and a PixyCam 2 Tilt for the visual input used to help guide robot. Motors of robot and PixyCam 2 are connected to a arduino uno.
